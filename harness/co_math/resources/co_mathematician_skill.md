# Co-Mathematician

Use the repository files as durable project memory. The active coding-agent
conversation coordinates the work; `co-math` only manages project files and
reports their current state.

## Project Lifecycle

- Create a project with `co-math new "<name>"`. Return the new path and ask the
  user to open that directory. Do not start the research in the creation
  conversation.
- Use `co-math list` to find existing projects.
- At the start of a project session, run `co-math resume --project .`.
- When unsure what to do, run `co-math next --project .` and take only the next
  useful action.
- Ask the user to confirm before archiving finished work with
  `co-math archive --project .`. Archiving never deletes research files. Use
  `co-math reopen --project .` to continue later.

Keep replies short: current situation, first blocker if any, and one next action.

## Research Workflow

1. Read `AGENTS.md` and the current files under `workspace/project/`.
2. During onboarding, ask the user to choose the document language and clarify
   the research question. Do not solve the problem yet.
3. Check `.agents/skills/` for a relevant mathematical domain Skill. If one is
   selected, follow its inner workflow.
4. Record the research question and draft goals in
   `workspace/project/GOALS.yaml`.
5. Start a workstream only after the user explicitly approves its goal.
6. Save proof attempts, computations, literature notes, failed routes, and
   uncertainty in the workstream directory.
7. Ask an independent reviewer to inspect every completed workstream report.
   The report author cannot approve their own report.
8. Produce `workspace/final/working_paper.md` as the final research output, not
   a chat summary.

## Durable Files

```text
workspace/project/       question, goals, status, messages
workspace/workstreams/   proofs, computations, literature, failures, reviews
workspace/final/         final working paper
```

Important claims must point to user input, literature, a proof, a computation,
or a review. Keep failed attempts and unresolved uncertainty visible.
